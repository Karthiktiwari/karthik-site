Welcome to my personal blog.

I’m Karthik Tiwari, a software engineer working at the intersection of infrastructure, AI systems, and creative automation. Over the past few years, I've worked across industries — from high-scale return logistics and data pipelines at Walmart to AI-augmented developer platforms at Intuit.

This site is a space for me to share technical insights, system design notes, and lessons learned while building tools that integrate intelligence into workflows. Most recently, I’ve been working on **Amplifier** — a multi-agent platform that generates brand creatives using layout-aware templates, vision-language models, and image-to-image refinement.

Through this blog, I plan to document:
- Practical applications of generative AI in production
- System architecture decisions from my engineering work
- Build logs and experiments from projects like Amplifier

If you're interested in AI, systems thinking, or how infrastructure and creativity intersect — you're in the right place.

Thanks for stopping by.
