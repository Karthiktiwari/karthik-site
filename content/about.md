I'm Karthik Tiwari, a software engineer focused on building intelligent, scalable systems at the intersection of AI and infrastructure.

I currently work at **Intuit**, where I lead initiatives around event-driven lifecycle management platforms. My role involves integrating large language models (LLMs), RAG pipelines, and GraphQL APIs into internal developer tools, improving engineering efficiency and accelerating feature delivery across the organization.

Previously, I was at **Walmart Global Tech**, where I developed customer returns infrastructure, automated financial reconciliation workflows, and built real-time analytics pipelines using PySpark and Spring Boot.

## Featured Project: [Amplifier](https://v0-marketing-agency-homepage-eight.vercel.app/)

Amplifier is a creative AI platform designed to help marketing teams generate high-quality brand assets efficiently. It combines:

- Large Language agent pipelines
- Trends aware Relevant Keywords and Blog Posts generation
- Imagen-based Social Media Post Generation
- Integration with Google Trends dashboards

This platform is currently deployed using Vercel and a Java Spring backend. It reflects my interest in combining generative AI with real-world creative workflows.
